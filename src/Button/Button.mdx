# Button

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

## Usage guidelines

Buttons are used for a wide variety of reasons: to submit a form, open a modal, or to generally take action on a page.

Buttons should NOT be used for navigation. Clicking a link should generally not change the user's browser location.

## Usage

### Basic usage

Import the button and use it:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Basic} />
