# Box

The Box component is a generic layout component, intended to be an easy way to apply margin and padding.

You can think of the Box component like a `div` with super powers.

## Usage guidelines

### When to use it

This should be your go to component when you need any kind of container. It is one of the fundamental building blocks of our system.

### When not to use it

If you need Flexbox capabilities, please use the [Flex](../Flex) component instead.

If you need to align items to a grid, please use the [Grid](../Grid) component.

## Usage

### Basic usage

In its simplest form, the Box is just a container:

<Canvas of={BoxStories.Basic} />

### Margin and Padding

From there, you can add margin and padding around the Box's children:

<Canvas of={BoxStories.WithMarginAndPadding} />

The allowed values for margin and padding are integers which increment by one. These map to our standard design tokens under the hood.

### Margin and Padding on particular sides

You can apply different values to each side of the Box by using any of the `marginTop`, `marginRight`, `marginBottom`, or `marginLeft` props (with similar naming conventions for padding).

<Canvas of={BoxStories.SpacingOnIndividualSides} />

Additionally, you can apply spacing to the top and bottom with `marginY` and to the left and right with `marginX`.

<Canvas of={BoxStories.WithXYShorthands} />

### Shorthand props

Each margin and padding prop also comes with a related shorthand. For instance, instead of passing `marginTop`, you can pass `mt`.
